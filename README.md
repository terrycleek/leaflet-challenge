Module 15 Challenge

## Leaflet-Part-1 
Only did this part of the challange as I am constrainted on time with work and group project.
Had multiple issues first with writing the code. Struggled quite a bit. I also got to the point with referencing help I wasnt able to generate a the index.html file in a web browser. Even with have someone from askBCS look at it we coulndt figure it out. I was eventually able to get the earthquakes to show without the map. I had to reference the solutions guide for being able to get the map to show. 
let basemap = L.tileLayer(
    "https://{s}.tile.opentopomap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'",
    {

    });
    
Also I referenced help with indentations as I was getting squiqly mark errors with the code. 

for some reason my code wasnt showing an error but maybe a bracket was off, althought I couldnt see how. I am pretty unfamiliar with javascript.. Once referenced I was able to generate the map. 

* note, I also had to move some of the files around. I changed the location of the javascript folder on suggestion from the askBCS tudor. In order to troubleshoot the map not showing. This also adjusted the index.html and css file slightly.
